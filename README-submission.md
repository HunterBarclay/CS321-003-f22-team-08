# Reflection

Provide a reflection by each of the team member (in a separate subsection)

## Reflection (Team member name: Hunter Barclay)
This project was pretty fun. I enjoy actually using a build system for a school project instead of juggling around a ton of class files. The utility classes were almost satisfying and the database integration was really insightful as I've never really managed database stuff on my own before. All in all, 10 out of 10, would do again.

## Reflection (Team member name: Tyler Pierce)
I thought that this project was overall a lot to handle. It was my first time really working on a computer science project in a group, so it was difficult to figure out the dynamic with that. It was also difficult at times working with git because I didn't remember specific commands and how to do things with git and making sure things are merging well. It was also my first time using branches in git which was interesting and gave me good experience for the future. I did think it was hard to see the overall idea of the project for a long time. Once I eventually saw the idea of the project, things became easier. There were lots of bugs that I had made which was frustrating. It was also hard working in a group because we had to wait for other things to be done before we could effectively test our pieces. Overall though, I think it didn't go too bad and I'm happy with the results.
